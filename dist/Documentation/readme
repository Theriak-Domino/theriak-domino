These are translations readable for Theriak and Domino of the THERMOCALC database
tcds55.txt, personal communication of R. Powell, September 2004.
(Some solution models. (e.g. Chlorite solution cannot be translated to the Theriak philosophy)
Includes the solution models proposed in White, RW, Powell, R & Holland, TJB (2007): Progress relating to 
calculation of partial melting equilibria for metapelites. Journal of Metamorphic Geology, 25, 511-527.
(translated from tx-NCKFMASHTO.txt in tc330 download.)
Older solution models are commented out.

Note that updated versions of the Holland & Powell (1998) ds5.5 can be obtained from the associated
Git Hub site https://github.com/Theriak-Domino/Databases.

tcds62cid
---------
Translation of tc-ds62.txt from http://www.metamorph.geo.uni-mainz.de/thermocalc/dataset6/index.html
last line: tc-ds62.txt produced at 20.08 on Mon 6 Feb,2012 (sigfit =  1.028)
note: iron is commented out, because it tends to become stable.
You may have to comment out further phases if not desired: e.g. zoisite, stilpnomelane, microcline
If not needed, comment out the F3-phases.

====================================================================================
Installation on Macintosh OS X (Is tested on OS X 3.7 - 10.15.4)
====================================================================================
Unzip TheriakDominoMAC.zip (Intel and macos 11.0 or greater) or TheriakDominoMACAS.zip (Apple 
Silicon and macos 12.0 or greater). double-clicking should work, else donwload the free
expander software from http://www.stuffit.com/mac/index.html.

Prepare the Terminal application: 
We assume a very basic level of understanding of use of the Terminal application.
The terminal application is usually located on the start-up disk in the Folder
"Applications/Utilities"
Drag the Terminal application to the Dock for easy subsequent access to the Terminal.
In the menu "Terminal / Preferences" choose the shell and the appropriate settings
(e.g. Text and background colours). Define the Dimensions with 133 Columns and 30 to 50 Rows,
or whatever your preferred size is.

Copy the unzipped folder "TheriakDominoMAC.2023.03.06" or "TheriakDominoMACAS.2023.03.06" to your 
Home Directory or other directory of your choice. (The name of the Home Directory is your user
name) You may rename this unzipped directory to your choosing (don't use spaces in the name), 
and the instructions below assumes you rename it to TheriakDominoMAC. 

In order to start the programs from a Terminal and to keep your input files
separate from the programs, you need to set the THERDOM environment variable
to the path where the programs are stored and also to add this path to the searchpath for
executing programs.

The folder "Working" contains the file "bash_profile" and “.zshrc”
Copy "bash_profile" (for bash) or "zshrc" (for zsh) to your Home directory (if you already
have one of these profiles in your home directory, you can read the provided profiles in a text
editor and copy the commands that are needed to add THERDOM to your path to your existing user 
profile). Edit the file in a text editor to define the location path to your Program directory, 
using correct directory names for wherever you copied/moved the unzipped distribution directory to.
Write the name of your Home directory instead of "capi" (if your user name contains blanks, 
these blanks have to be escaped by writing as "\ " (backslash, blank)):

	export THERDOM=/Users/capi/TheriakMAC/TheriakDomino
change to 
	export THERDOM=/Users/UserName/TheriakMAC/TheriakDomino


Save the file as ".bash_profile" or ".zshrc" in the Home directory. (The first
character is a dot, there is no extension (like .txt etc.); more recent versions of macos
use the zsh terminal, which reads .zshrc). Some editors refuse to save a name beginning with ".".
If all fails, save without the dot, then start the Terminal, navigate to your home directory if
not there (type: cd ~  and hit enter if you are not sure you are in your home directory) and type:
 "mv bash_profile .bash_profile", or "mv zshrc .zshrc"then quit the Terminal.

Note: Because of the dot, the file ".bash_profile" becomes invisible.

NOTE: the path+filenames should not exceed 250 characters.

The following are my personal preferences, You may as well delete these lines.
PS1="`whoami` \#>  (or PROMPT='%n %h %#>') 
	(defines the text of the Terminal prompt (username and line-number))
alias  ther="cd..."  (go to working directory, is just for convenience)
alias ls="ls -aF"
echo ~.bash_profile read  (confirms, that the .bash_profile file was read)
echo pwd: $PWD (prints the path to the Home directory at login)

Get ready to use THERIAK-DOMINO

Open the Folder "Working", and place its window where it will not be completely hidden
by the Terminal. All opening and editing of files is made from this window.
The THERIAK-DOMINO programs are run from the Terminal.

Start the Terminal application
cd to the working directory.
Or use "cdto" (see: https://github.com/jbtule/cdto )
You are now ready to use THERIAK-DOMINO. You can invoke any program by typing its name.

Some UNIX commands you need, to run THERIAK-DOMINO on a Mac
-----------------------------------------------------------
pwd             displays the name of the current working directory.
cd              changes the current working directory:
       cd       (go to your Home directory)
       cd ../   (one directory level up)
       cd name  (change to directory "name" (inside working directory))
ls              list files and directories in working directory
mv name1 name2  rename the file "name1" to "name2"
rm name         delete (remove) file "name"
exit            close the Terminal


============================================================================
Installation on WIN
============================================================================
Unstuff TheriakDominoWIN/Programs.zip 

Copy the folder "TheriakDominoWin" to a folder of your choice, for example C:\ 
Note that in this case, the programs reside in the folder 
C:\TheriakDominoWin\Programs
(if you put it somewhere else you have to edit the start.bat file and set
THERDOM= to the path of the Programs folder)

In order to start the programs from a Terminal and to keep your input files
separate from the programs, copy the "start.bat" file to any directory containing
a THERIN file and a database.

It is recommended for your work with theriak/domino, that you unhide file extensions.
(Click on the “Tools” menu and select “Folder Options…”. Click on the “View” tab.
In the opened “View” tab, find the option “Hide extensions for known file types” and
uncheck the box beside it. Click on “Apply to All Folders” and then on “OK”)

Double-click on start.bat. This will open a (usually) black console window titled
“C:\WINNT\System32\cmd.exe”. Adjust the “Screen buffer size” to a width of 133 and
a height of at least 200. Adjust also the physical “Window size” according to the size
of your monitor
Open the file "start.bat"
You can invoke any program by typing its name.

Some useful commands to use in a console window
-----------------------------------------------
cd (chdir)        displays the name of the current working directory or changes to another directory. Examples.
      cd ..\      (change directory one level higher)
      cd name     (change to directory "name" inside your working directory)
      cd ..\Docs  (change one level higher and then to directory Docs) example to move 
dir               (list files and directories in working directory)
ren name1 name2   (rename the file "name1" to "name2")
del name          (delete file "name")
exit              (quits the console window (terminates cmd.exe)

I hope you encounter no major difficulties
