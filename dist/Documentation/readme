  These are translations readable for Theriak and Domino of the THERMOCALC database
  tcds55.txt, personal communication of R. Powell, September 2004.
  (Note that some solution models (e.g. Chlorite solution) cannot be exactly translated 
  to the Theriak philosophy due to the well-known equipartitioning problems)
  It includes the solution models proposed in White, RW, Powell, R & Holland, TJB (2007): 
  Progress relating to calculation of partial melting equilibria for metapelites. 
  Journal of Metamorphic Geology, 25, 511-527. (translated from tx-NCKFMASHTO.txt in 
  tc330 download.)
  Older solution models are commented out.

  Note that updated versions of the Holland & Powell (1998) ds55 thermodynamic and 
  ax files for use in Theriak-Domino can be obtained from the associated Git Hub 
  site https://github.com/Theriak-Domino/Databases.

  last line: tc-ds62.txt produced at 20.08 on Mon 6 Feb,2012 (sigfit =  1.028)
  note: iron is commented out, because it tends to become stable. You may have to comment out 
  further phases if not desired: e.g. zoisite, stilpnomelane, microcline.
  If not needed, comment out the F3-phases.

====================================================================================
2. Installation on Macintosh OS X (This release is tested on macos 11.x and 12.6.2)
====================================================================================

Quick Instructions for experienced users:
-----------------------------------------
1. Download the appropriate release package from the Git Hub site:
  - TheriakDominoMACi.2023.03.06.zip: package for Intel macs.
  - TheriakDominoMACas.2023.03.06.zip: package for Apple Silicon macs.
2. Unzip the downloaded package, and copy the directory to your home directory or
   other directory of your choice (avoid spaces in path). The unzipped distribution
   will by default have the directory name TheriakDominoMAC. If you work with multiple
   versions of the programs, my preference is to change the directory name to include 
   the version number (TheriakDomino.2023.03.16).
3. Update your .bash_profile file (if Terminal is set to use the bash shell) or .zshrc  
   file (if Terminal is set to use the zsh shell) in your home directory to set the 
   environment variable THERDOM, and to prepend the THERDOM environment variable to  
   your PATH variable. The THERDOM variable should be set to the path containing the 
   Programs subdirectory (the Programs folder within the unzipped distribution). Close  
   and restart Terminal so the changed profile is read by the Terminal application. To 
   ensure the variables are set correctly, enter/type "echo $THERDOM" to make sure the 
   path to your Programs directory is listed correctly, and type/enter "echo $PATH" to   
   make sure this path appears somewhere in the list of paths given for the PATH 
   variable.
4. You can now set up any working directory with a database/ax file and a THERIN file.
   cd in the Terminal to your working directory, and you are ready to start using
   the various programs (theriak, domino, etc.). Try to keep your working directory
   path farily short (< 250 characters). If you receive errors about files not being
   found when running, ensure your path is not too large (use a shorter path
   location). NOTE: Run the programs by starting them from the Terminal command line
   (or with a wrapper script), and not by double-clicking on the binary application 
   file itself.

Detailed Instructions for new users:
------------------------------------
1 and 2. Follow steps 1 and 2 in the Quick Instructions above to download, unzip, and 
move the distribution directory/folder to your Home directory (and optionally rename). 
(Note: The name of the Home Directory is your user name). 

Double-clicking the downloaded zip should unzip it; if not right/2-finger click and 
Open With one of the system-recommended unarchivers. If none are available, find a 
freely available expander/unarchiver software to install and use.

The instructions below assume you keep the default directory name of TheriakDominoMAC, 
but if you rename the folder to a different name, all you need to do is substitute 
that name below where TheriakDominoMAC appears. 

3. Prepare the Terminal application for use: 
We assume a very basic level of understanding of use of the Terminal application.
The terminal application is usually located on the start-up disk in the Folder
"Applications/Utilities". It is recommended to drag the Terminal application to 
the Dock for easy subsequent access to the Terminal. In the menu "Terminal / Preferences" 
choose the shell and the appropriate settings (e.g. Text and background colours). 
Define the Dimensions with 133 Columns and 30 to 50 Rows, or whatever your preferred 
size is. Newer macs are recommending to use the zsh shell in Terminal, which can be 
specified by finding a section in the Terminal Preferences that says "Shells open with" 
or similar, and specifying the command /bin/zsh

In order to start the programs from a Terminal and to keep your input files separate 
from the programs, you need to set the THERDOM environment variable to the path where 
the programs are stored and add this path to the searchpath for executing programs. 
This is most easily achieved by making the changes described below in your 
.bash_profile file (older macs, using the bash shell from Terminal) or .zshrc file 
(newer macs or when using the zsh shell from Terminal); these files are located in 
your Home directory.

The folder "Working" contains the text profile files "bash_profile" and “zshrc” to 
illustrate what settings should be in your .bash_profile or .zshrc files. Copy 
"bash_profile" (for bash) or "zshrc" (for zsh) to your Home directory (if you 
already have one of these profiles in your home directory, you can read the provided 
profiles in a text editor and copy the commands that are needed to add THERDOM to 
your path in your existing user profile file). Edit the file in a text editor to 
define the location path to your Programs directory, using correct directory names 
for wherever you copied/moved the unzipped distribution directory to. Write the name 
of your Home directory instead of "capi" as shown below. (If your user name contains 
blanks, these blanks have to be escaped by writing as "\ " (backslash, blank)).

The minimum information that needs to be included in the .bash_profile or .zshrc file 
are these 2 lines:

	export THERDOM=/Users/capi/TheriakDominoMAC/Programs
  export PATH="$PATH:$THERDOM"

where you will change capi to your home directory name, and change TheriakDominoMAC if 
you changed the unzipped directory name to something else:

	export THERDOM=/Users/YourUserName/YourTheriakDominoDirectoryName/Programs
  export PATH="$PATH:$THERDOM"

Save the file as ".bash_profile" or ".zshrc" in the Home directory. (The first
character is a dot, there is no extension (like .txt etc.). Some editors refuse to 
save a name beginning with "."; If this happens, save without the dot, then start 
the Terminal, navigate to your home directory if not there (type: cd  and hit enter 
if you are not sure you are in your home directory) and type:

  "mv bash_profile .bash_profile"
  or 
  "mv zshrc .zshrc"  

then quit Terminal and restart Terminal so it will read your new or updated profile 
file you just changed.

Note: Because of the dot, the file ".bash_profile" becomes invisible.

NOTE: the path+filenames should not exceed 250 characters.

The following are my personal preferences, You may as well delete these lines.
PS1="`whoami` \#>  (or PROMPT='%n %h %#>') 
	(defines the text of the Terminal prompt (username and line-number))
alias  ther="cd..."  (go to working directory, is just for convenience)
alias ls="ls -aF"
echo ~.bash_profile read  (confirms, that the .bash_profile file was read)
echo pwd: $PWD (prints the path to the Home directory at login)

4. Get ready to use THERIAK-DOMINO:

Open the Folder "Working" and place its window where it will not be completely hidden
by the Terminal. All opening and editing of files is made from this window.
The THERIAK-DOMINO programs are run from the Terminal.

Start the Terminal application
cd to the working directory.
Or use "cdto" (see: https://github.com/jbtule/cdto )
You are now ready to use THERIAK-DOMINO. You can invoke any program by typing its name.

Some UNIX commands you need, to run THERIAK-DOMINO on a Mac
-----------------------------------------------------------
pwd             displays the name of the current working directory.
cd              changes the current working directory:
       cd       (go to your Home directory)
       cd ../   (one directory level up)
       cd name  (change to directory "name" (inside working directory))
ls              list files and directories in working directory
mv name1 name2  rename the file "name1" to "name2"
rm name         delete (remove) file "name"
exit            close the Terminal


============================================================================
3. Installation on WIN
============================================================================
Unstuff TheriakDominoWIN.2023.03.06.zip

Copy the resulting folder "TheriakDominoWIN" to a folder of your choice, for example C:\ 
Note that in this case, the programs reside in the folder 
C:\TheriakDominoWIN\Programs
(if you put it somewhere else you have to edit the start.bat file and set
THERDOM= to the path of the Programs folder)

In order to start the programs from a Terminal and to keep your input files
separate from the programs, copy the "start.bat" file to any directory containing
a THERIN file and a database.

It is recommended for your work with theriak/domino, that you unhide file extensions.
(Click on the “Tools” menu and select “Folder Options…”. Click on the “View” tab.
In the opened “View” tab, find the option “Hide extensions for known file types” and
uncheck the box beside it. Click on “Apply to All Folders” and then on “OK”)

Double-click on start.bat. This will open a (usually) black console window titled
“C:\WINNT\System32\cmd.exe”. Adjust the “Screen buffer size” to a width of 133 and
a height of at least 200. Adjust also the physical “Window size” according to the size
of your monitor
Open the file "start.bat"
You can invoke any program by typing its name.

Some useful commands to use in a console window
-----------------------------------------------
cd (chdir)        displays the name of the current working directory or changes to another directory. Examples.
      cd ..\      (change directory one level higher)
      cd name     (change to directory "name" inside your working directory)
      cd ..\Docs  (change one level higher and then to directory Docs) example to move 
dir               (list files and directories in working directory)
ren name1 name2   (rename the file "name1" to "name2")
del name          (delete file "name")
exit              (quits the console window (terminates cmd.exe)
