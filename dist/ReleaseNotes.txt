2022.03.06 Release Notes

The Theriak-Domino suite of programs are now released with the GNU GPLv3 
open source license. This release focussed on getting programs theriak 
and domino to work better with the Holland and Powell (2011) database
updates  ds62, ds633, and the current set of metabasite and igneous activity
composition models on the HPx-eos website (the mb50 and ig50 ax file models).

A more complete list of changes are found in the CHANGELOG.md text file in 
the root directory, along with older release notes in Documentation/history. 

Instructions for installation of programs and program use are in the 
Documentation/readme file. 

Detailed explanations of the programs and their general use are in 
Documentation/TheriakDominoGuide.pdf. 

Basic instructions for building programs from source using updated makefiles 
for Mac, Linux and Windows can be found on the main page of the GitHub site:
https://github.com/Theriak-Domino/theriak-domino

Updated versions of databases and ax model translations are and will continue 
to be posted on the Databases GitHub site: https://github.com/Theriak-Domino/Databases
