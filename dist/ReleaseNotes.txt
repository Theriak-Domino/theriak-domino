2022.01.02beta Release Notes

The Theriak-Domino suite of programs are now released with the GNU GPLv3 
open source license. This release focussed on getting programs theriak 
and domino to work better with the Holland and Powell (2011) database
update ds633 and the current set of metabasite and igneous activity
composition models on the HPx-eos website (the mb50 and ig50 ax file models).

A more complete list of changes are found in the CHANGELOG.md text file in 
the root directory. Instructions for installation of programs and program
use are in the Documentation directory. Basic instructions for building programs 
from source using updated makefiles for Mac, Linux and Windows can be found on 
the main page of the GitHub site: https://github.com/Theriak-Domino/theriak-domino

Updated versions of databases and translations will be posted on the Databases 
GitHub site: https://github.com/Theriak-Domino/Databases
